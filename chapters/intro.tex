\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Research Background}
In recent years, X has attracted increasing attention due to its wide
applications in Y. However, existing methods still face challenges such as
Z and limited scalability.

\section{Research Objectives and Scope}
The purpose of this study is to develop an improved framework that
addresses these issues by combining A and B techniques.

\section{Research Methods}
This research adopts both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.
Data were collected from multiple sources to ensure reliability.

\section{Thesis Structure}
The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:
Chapter~\ref{chap:Mathematics and Formulae} reviews related work;
Chapter~\ref{chap:method} introduces the proposed approach;
Chapter~\ref{chap:experiment} presents experiments and results;
and Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes the thesis and suggests future work.
